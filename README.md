# Text-Game-freecodecamp-
A text game I made under instruction from https://www.freecodecamp.org. This is not my original idea/concept, but is still a decent showcase of JavaScript fundamentals.

Showcases some use/understanding of functions, embedded if/else/else if statements and navigation through html using querySelector.
